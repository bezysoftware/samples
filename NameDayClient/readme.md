#Name day client sample

The app Sv√°tky+ (Name Days) has a bacground app service, which other apps can use to query who has a nameday on a specific day (typically today).

Take a look at this sample, all the interesting stuff is in the codebehind of the main page (MainPage.xaml.cs).

If you have questions, let me know!
